                  <h1>My Novatech Nagpur SDE Interview Experience</h1>

                   <p>I'm excited to share my experience interviewing for an SDE role at Novatech Nagpur. The journey started with a technical interview on February 25th. On March 5th, I received an email informing me about the machine round scheduled for March 7th. This news made me a bit nervous, but I immediately began preparing by revising DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), aptitude and reasoning, and software engineering concepts.</p>

                   <h2>The Machine Round</h2>

                   <p>On March 7th, The test was scheduled from 11 AM to 2 PM, and we arrived around 10 AM. Upon reaching the Novatech office, I had the opportunity to interact with some of the techies working there. I had a particularly good conversation with a brother named Vinay Chaitanya from Hyderabad, which helped ease my nerves.</p>

                   <p>The test itself consisted of several sections:</p>

                   <ul>
                      <li><strong>MCQs:</strong> There were 30 multiple-choice questions covering Java, OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming), and fundamental concepts. I felt confident about my answers in this section.</li>
                      <li><strong>Coding Questions:</strong> Two coding questions were presented, ranging from medium to hard difficulty. I successfully solved one question and partially solved the second, passing some of the test cases.</li>
                      <li><strong>Aptitude and Reasoning:</strong> This section went well, and I felt I performed adequately.</li>
                      <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> This was the section where I struggled the most. As a third-year student, I hadn't yet covered software engineering in depth, which is typically a fourth-year subject. Despite my limited knowledge, I tried my best to answer the questions.</li>
                   </ul>

                   <p>I completed the test around 1:30 PM, and after waiting for a while, around 6 PM, I received an email informing me that I hadn't cleared the software engineering theory section. It was disappointing, but I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being prepared for all aspects of the interview process.</p>

                   <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                   <p>This experience highlighted the importance of comprehensive preparation, especially for software engineering concepts. It was a good learning experience, and I appreciate the opportunity to have interviewed with Novatech.</p>

                   <p>Even though I didn't get the job, I'm grateful for the experience and will continue to work hard to improve my skills. Thank you for reading!</p>
